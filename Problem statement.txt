/*IEI Studentsâ€™ Chapter CSE (AOT) is organizing a one day tech conference for students and professionals.
Attendees can register for the event and submit their conference paper for approval. It would be a paid
event for professionals and outside AOT attendees. AOT students will get free entry by registering on the
site.
You need to develop a website for Conference. The website should serve as an all-inclusive platform
for the conference attendees and potential participants.
Participants are required to create a conference website with the following key features:
1. Navbar: A sticky and responsive navigation bar at the top with the conference logo and menu
items (Home, Conference Details, Speakers, Sessions, Journal Submission, Contact, Login/Signup).
2. Conference Details: Present essential information about the conference, including its theme, dates,
location, and any other pertinent details that would provide a comprehensive overview of the event.
3. Conference Speaker Details and Session Timelines: Design an interactive section that
showcases information about the conference speakers and their respective sessions. Additionally,
include a visually appealing and dynamic timeline for the conference sessions, allowing users to view
the schedule at a glance.
4. Journal Submission Link and Guidelines: Provide a well-defined page or section containing the
necessary details for authors to submit their research papers or journal articles for potential
presentation at the conference.
5. Optional: Login/Signup Button: Include an optional feature for attendees to create accounts and log in,
granting them personalized access to exclusive conference resources and materials.
